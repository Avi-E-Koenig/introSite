## Purpose

This directory stores fast-reference context for AI agents working on `introSite`.
Each subfolder captures a different facet of the project so models can load only
the slices they need (structure, conventions, flows, features) and answer
questions or plan changes without repeatedly re-indexing the entire repo.

## Quick Index

### Structure
- [Project Structure](./structure/project-structure.md)
- [Deployment](./structure/deployment.md)

### Conventions
- [Frontend Practices](./conventions/frontend.md)

### Flows
- [Navigation & Runtime Flow](./flows/navigation.md)

### Features
- [Current Features](./features/current-features.md)

Keep documents concise, update them when behavior or architecture changes, and
link to source paths so agents can quickly drill down when needed.
